## What is RibbonUI?
RibbonUI is a free and open source lightweight UI framework built with reference to Microsoft Ribbon design style.

## Why reference Microsoft Ribbon?
Microsoft Ribbon has been popular all over the world since it was released together with Microsoft Office 2007, and has had a profound influence on the design of subsequent Microsoft Office and even Windows.
Referring to the Microsoft Ribbon style design is partly a personal tribute to such a great design, and partly because people are more familiar with the interface and logic of the Microsoft Ribbon style, which makes it easier to get started.

## Why write in QML?
Qt has become one of the world's most famous and widely used programming frameworks, with cross-platform features that allow programs to run as a single set of code not only on mainstream Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems, but also on mobile and even embedded devices.

QML, as a design language launched along with Qt Quick, draws on the advantages of CSS, HTML and other commonly used elements of front-end design, and truly achieves the "Quick" in the name of the general quickness - quick to get started, quick to get started, quick to run, and quick to deploy. 

Unlike traditional Qt widget programming, Qt Quick users can quickly build their own style of application without in-depth knowledge of C++ and its series of components, and due to the nature of the QML scripting language, it is possible to load new pages/components while the application is running.

With its low barrier to get start, Qt Quick will become the future trend of Qt programming.

RibbonUI written in QML can make full use of the advantages of Qt Quick, to provide a set of beautiful interface, easy to port, cross-platform, easy to learn UI framework for entry and advanced users, to help users to quickly form the application on the ground.

## RibbonUI development plan
The current plan is to add enough common components to RibbonUI, and provide as much detailed documentation for users' reference.

Currently, RibbonUI is maintained by me in my spare time, the development speed will be a bit slow, welcome all interested developers to join us!

There is no funding for this project, it's just me made for love ðŸ˜‰ ~
